# Dice Rolling Game

Welcome to the **Dice Rolling Game**! Roll the dice, accumulate points, but be careful not to roll a 1 and lose your turn. The goal is to reach a score of over 100 points to become the ultimate winner. You can play the game by following this [link](https://florianparzivalluther.github.io/diceGame/).

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 points or more.

2. **Starting:** The game begins with you, the player, rolling the dice. Click the "[Roll Dice](https://florianparzivalluther.github.io/diceGame/)" button to roll.

3. **Rolling Rules:**
   - If you roll a number between 2 and 6, that value is added to your current score.
   - Rolling a 1 ends your turn, and you lose all the points accumulated during that turn.
   
4. **Storing Your Score:** To prevent losing your points, you can click the "[Hold](https://florianparzivalluther.github.io/diceGame/)" button to add your current turn's score to your total score. Your turn ends, and it's your opponent's turn.

5. **Winning:** The game continues in this manner until one player reaches a total score of 100 or more points. That player is declared the winner.

6. **Reset:** To start a new game, click the "[New Game](https://florianparzivalluther.github.io/diceGame/)" button.

## Tips

- Be strategic! Decide whether to roll again or hold based on your current score and risk tolerance.

- Keep an eye on your opponent's score to gauge your strategy better.

- The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins, so be cautious when you're close to victory.
